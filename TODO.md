- FOR KLARI: create a multi-user system filtering direct messages, messages from the server, and messages from the superuser (console).

- Also start mounting EVERY node module, no idea when it might come in handy.

- Add a "power" object to config for scheduling wake times and what not
- Add power control commands like shutdown, reboot, sleep

- for making more klari sounds, go to IBM's tts machine and remember that pitch="150Hz"

- PLEASE ADD A BASIC ROLEPLAY MANAGER SOON (Turn scheduling, initiative, actions, environment)

RPG.js plans:
- allows you to make and edit and store (multiple) character(s) on a user account
- provides extra utilities from the comforts of tabletop roleplay (calculator, dice roller, automator, etc)
- provides utilities for controlling audio and visual immersion (sound effects, ambiance, dynamic soundtracks, game art, etc)
- allows for the creation and management of sharded worlds as discord channels
- includes a text-based game engine for handling of props, fluids, and environments
