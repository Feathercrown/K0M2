- FOR JUSTIN: create a multi-user system filtering direct messages, messages from the server, and messages from the superuser (console).

- Also start mounting EVERY node module, no idea when it might come in handy.

- Add a config editing command for working with KLARI remotely
- Add a "power" object to config for scheduling wake times and what not
- Add power control commands like shutdown, reboot, sleep

- Add the startup sound with ffmpeg (and for making more klari sounds, go to IBM's tts machine and remember that pitch="150Hz")

- PLEASE ADD A BASIC ROLEPLAY MANAGER SOON (Turn scheduling, initiative, actions, environment)
